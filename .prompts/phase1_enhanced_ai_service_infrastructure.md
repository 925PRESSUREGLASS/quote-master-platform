# ðŸš€ Quote Master Pro - ENHANCED AI SERVICE INFRASTRUCTURE

## Context
You are implementing Quote Master Pro, an enterprise-grade AI-powered quote generation platform. This is ENHANCED AI SERVICE INFRASTRUCTURE of a 9-phase implementation plan.

## Current Project Structure
- **Backend**: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy, multi-provider AI service (OpenAI/Claude/Azure)
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis caching
- **Architecture**: Clean architecture with domain-driven design

## Phase Objective
 
*Duration: 3-4 days | Priority: HIGH*

### Goals
- Enhance existing AI service with production-ready features
- Add distributed tracing and smart routing
- Implement advanced monitoring and health checks

### Implementation Tasks

#### 1.1 OpenTelemetry Integration
```python
# Files to create/enhance:
src/services/ai/monitoring/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”œâ”€â”€ tracing.py           # OpenTelemetry setup
â”œâ”€â”€ metrics.py           # Custom metrics collection
â”œâ”€â”€ health_checker.py    # Provider health monitoring
â””â”€â”€ dashboard_data.py    # Real-time dashboard data
```

#### 1.2 Smart Provider Routing
```python
# Enhancement to existing ai_service.py
class SmartRouting:
    - Analyze prompt complexity (token count, task type)
    - Route simple tasks to GPT-3.5, complex to GPT-4/Claude
    - Consider provider latency and cost
    - Implement A/B testing for routing decisions
```

#### 1.3 Advanced Circuit Breakers
```python
# Enhancement to existing providers
class AdvancedCircuitBreaker:
    - Gradual recovery with partial traffic
    - Provider-specific failure thresholds
    - Automatic quality degradation handling
    - Real-time status reporting
```

#### 1.4 Provider Performance Analytics
```python
src/services/ai/analytics/
â”œâ”€â”€ performance_tracker.py  # Real-time performance metrics
â”œâ”€â”€ cost_optimizer.py       # Automatic cost optimization
â”œâ”€â”€ quality_analyzer.py     # Response quality trends
â””â”€â”€ usage_predictor.py      # Usage pattern prediction
```

### Deliverables
- [ ] Enhanced AI service with smart routing
- [ ] Distributed tracing implementation
- [ ] Real-time health monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Provider performance analytics system
- [ ] Advanced circuit breaker patterns

## Implementation Instructions
1. Generate complete, production-ready implementations
2. Include comprehensive error handling and logging
3. Add type hints for Python code and proper TypeScript types
4. Follow existing code patterns and architecture
5. Include docstrings and comments for complex logic
6. Consider performance, security, and scalability
7. Generate corresponding test files where applicable

## Quality Requirements
- âœ… Production-ready code with error handling
- âœ… Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- âœ… Type safety (Python type hints, TypeScript)
- âœ… Security best practices
- âœ… Performance optimization
- âœ… Documentation and comments

## File Generation Format
When generating files, use this format:
```
# File: path/to/file.py
# Dependencies: package1>=1.0.0, package2>=2.0.0
# Description: Brief description of the file purpose
