## Implementation Instructions
1. Generate complete, production-ready implementations
2. Include comprehensive error handling and logging
3. Add type hints for Python code and proper TypeScript types
4. Follow existing code patterns and architecture
5. Include docstrings and comments for complex logic
6. Consider performance, security, and scalability
7. Generate corresponding test files where applicable

## Quality Requirements
- âœ… Production-ready code with error handling
- âœ… Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- âœ… Type safety (Python type hints, TypeScript)
- âœ… Security best practices
- âœ… Performance optimization
- âœ… Documentation and comments

## File Generation Format
When generating files, use this format:
```
# File: path/to/file.py
# Dependencies: package1>=1.0.0, package2>=2.0.0
# Description: Brief description of the file purpose

[Complete file content here]
```

Generate all files needed for this phase. Ask if you need clarification on any requirements.
