## üöÄ How to Use in VS Code

### Option 1: Continue.dev Extension (Recommended)
```bash
1. Install Continue.dev extension in VS Code
2. Configure with OpenAI API key in ~/.continue/config.json
3. Open Continue sidebar (Ctrl+Shift+M or Cmd+Shift+M)
4. Copy content from phase file
5. Paste into Continue chat
6. Generate code files one by one
7. Review and save to appropriate locations
```

### Option 2: GitHub Copilot Chat
```bash
1. Ensure GitHub Copilot subscription is active
2. Open Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Shift+I)
3. Copy content from phase file
4. Paste and request code generation
5. Review generated code before accepting
```

## üìã Implementation Workflow

### Phase Execution Steps:
1. **Open Phase File**: Open the current phase .md file
2. **Copy Content**: Copy the entire prompt content  
3. **Paste to AI Tool**: Use Continue.dev or Copilot Chat
4. **Generate Code**: Request file generation one by one
5. **Review & Test**: Review generated code and run tests
6. **Commit Changes**: Git commit completed phase
7. **Move to Next**: Proceed to next phase

### Quality Checkpoints:
- [ ] Code compiles/runs without errors
- [ ] Tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Code follows project patterns
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Performance optimized
- [ ] Documentation included

## üéØ Pro Tips

### For Better Results:
- **Generate one file at a time** for complex components
- **Ask for specific file types**: "Generate the FastAPI router file"  
- **Request tests separately**: "Generate comprehensive tests for this service"
- **Specify file paths**: "Save to src/services/ai/monitoring/tracing.py"

### If Generation Stops:
- **Continue prompt**: "Continue generating the rest of the file"
- **Ask for specific sections**: "Generate the remaining methods"
- **Break into smaller parts**: Request specific functions/classes

### Token Management:
- Each phase file is ~2,000-3,000 tokens (safe for VS Code tools)
- If still too long, focus on one task section at a time
- Use "Generate X only" to focus on specific components

## üö® Important Notes

### Before Starting:
- [ ] Backup your current project
- [ ] Create a new branch: `git checkout -b implementation-phase-X`
- [ ] Ensure dependencies are installed
- [ ] Test current functionality works

### During Implementation:
- [ ] Test frequently as you generate code
- [ ] Follow existing code patterns and styles
- [ ] Update requirements.txt/package.json as needed
- [ ] Document any architectural decisions

### After Each Phase:
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Check for integration issues  
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Commit with descriptive message
- [ ] Tag phase completion

## üéñÔ∏è Success Metrics per Phase

### Phase 1: Enhanced AI Service
- [ ] OpenTelemetry tracing working
- [ ] Smart routing implemented
- [ ] Circuit breakers functional
- [ ] Health monitoring dashboard

### Phase 2: Testing Infrastructure  
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage achieved
- [ ] All test types implemented
- [ ] CI/CD integration working
- [ ] Quality gates enforced

... (continue for each phase)

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **"Code too long"**: Ask for specific sections
- **"Context lost"**: Restart and provide file context  
- **"Import errors"**: Check dependencies and file paths
- **"Tests failing"**: Generate tests separately and debug

### Getting Help:
- Reference the full `COMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Check existing code patterns in the project
- Use VS Code's built-in error highlighting
- Test incrementally as you build
