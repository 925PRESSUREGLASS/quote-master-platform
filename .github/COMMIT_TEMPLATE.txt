# Type should be one of the following:
# * feat:     A new feature
# * fix:      A bug fix
# * docs:     Documentation only changes
# * style:    Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
# * refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# * perf:     A code change that improves performance
# * test:     Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
# * chore:    Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
# * ci:       Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
# * build:    Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies

# Scope is optional and should be the name of the npm package affected (as perceived by person reading changelog)
# Examples: api, ui, core, auth, db, monitoring, etc.

# Subject line should:
# * use imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" or "changes"
# * don't capitalize first letter
# * no period (.) at the end
# * be 50 characters or less

# Body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
# Use imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" or "changes"
# Wrap at 72 characters

# Footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also the place to reference GitHub issues
# Examples:
# Closes #123
# Fixes #456
# Refs #789
