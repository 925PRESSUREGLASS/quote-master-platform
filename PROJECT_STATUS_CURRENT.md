- All phase 0 cleanup completed and applied
- Working tree clean with no pending changes

**‚úÖ Development Environment Verified**
- Python 3.11.9 confirmed and functional
- Virtual environment activated successfully
- FastAPI 0.104.1 and all dependencies installed
- Pre-commit hooks configured and operational

**‚úÖ GitHub Workflow Infrastructure**
- Comprehensive PR template (`.github/pull_request_template.md`)
- Conventional commit template (`.github/COMMIT_TEMPLATE.txt`)
- Enhanced Makefile with 30+ development targets
- Pre-commit configuration (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)

### üîß Current Technical Status

**Environment:**
- **Branch**: `CODEX-REF/BUILD`
- **Python**: 3.11.9 with virtual environment
- **Framework**: FastAPI 0.104.1
- **Tools**: Black, isort, flake8, pre-commit, pytest

**Known Issues:**
- Redis not running locally (expected - fallback to memory cache working)
- OpenTelemetry collector not available (expected for development)
- Some Pydantic V2 warnings (non-blocking)

### üöÄ Ready for Development

The project is now fully prepared for active development with:
- ‚úÖ Clean working tree
- ‚úÖ All dependencies installed
- ‚úÖ Code quality tools configured
- ‚úÖ GitHub workflow templates established
- ‚úÖ Knowledge preservation system in place
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive development Makefile

### üõ†Ô∏è Available Make Targets

Core development workflow available through Makefile:
```bash
# Code Quality
make lint          # Run all linting tools
make fmt           # Format code with black and isort
make typecheck     # Run mypy type checking

# Testing
make test          # Run all tests
make test-unit     # Unit tests only
make test-int      # Integration tests only
make cov           # Test coverage report

# Database
make migrate       # Run alembic migrations
make db-seed       # Seed database with test data

# Development
make dev           # Start development server
make clean         # Clean temporary files
```

**Next Steps**: The development environment is fully operational and ready for feature development, testing, and deployment workflows.
