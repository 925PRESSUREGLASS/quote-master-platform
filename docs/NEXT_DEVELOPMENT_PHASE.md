2. Implement feature with tests
3. Code review and testing
4. Merge to `development`
5. Regular deployment to staging
6. Weekly merges to `main` for production

### Code Review Process
- All PRs require at least one approval
- Automated testing must pass
- Code coverage must not decrease
- Performance impact assessment

## üéØ Ready to Start
